# Time-Series-Movement-Prediction-Feature-Engineering-and-Model-Comparison
You have stock data for four semiconductor companies: Analog Devices (ADI), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Xilinx (XLNX). This assignment will walk through some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing data and feature engineering, and comparing the performance of two models. This assignment is based on results reported by (Basak, Kar, Saha, Khaidem, and Dey 2019).  The assignment consists of seven parts arranged in three sections:  I. EDA Working with Dictionaries Plotting Time Series Preliminary Analysis II. Predicting Price Movement Exponential Smoothing Logistic Regression vs Random Forests Feature Engineering with Technical Indicators III. Analysis Short Answer Each stock data set is a .csv formatted file covering a twenty-year history of trading data between January 15, 2000 and January 15, 2020. The next cell loads each into a pandas dataframe. Following convention, we use the notation df to denote a pandas dataframe. You of course can use the type command to identify an object's datatype. You may also find the command whos helpful to list what variables are currently stored in memory, their size, and type.
